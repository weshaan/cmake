### What is CMake?

CMake is a tool designed to build, test, and package software. It uses a simple scripting language (CMakeLists.txt files) to define the build process. CMake generates native build files for various platforms and IDEs, such as Makefiles for Unix-like systems, Visual Studio solutions for Windows, and Xcode projects for macOS.

### Basic Concepts:

1. **CMakeLists.txt**: This is the main configuration file for CMake. It contains instructions for building your project.

2. **Source Directory and Build Directory**: CMake requires a source directory where your project's source code resides and a separate build directory where CMake generates build files.
