## 1. Variables and Conditionals:
CMake supports variables and conditionals, allowing you to make your build scripts more flexible and maintainable.

- **Variables**: You can define variables using the set() command and access them using ${} syntax. For example:
  > set(SOURCES file1.cpp file2.cpp) </br>
  add_executable(my_executable ${SOURCES})

- **Conditionals**: You can use if(), elseif(), and else() to conditionally execute commands based on certain conditions. For example:
  > if(WIN32)</br>
    message("Running on Windows")</br>
elseif(APPLE)</br>
    message("Running on macOS")</br>
else()</br>
    message("Running on Linux/Unix")</br>

## 2. Managing Libraries:
CMake simplifies the management of libraries, both system and external.

- **Finding Libraries**: Use find_package() to search for installed libraries. For example:
  > find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)

- **Linking Libraries**: After finding a library, you can link it to your target using target_link_libraries(). For example:
  > target_link_libraries(my_executable OpenGL::OpenGL)

## 3. Custom Commands and Targets:
You can define custom commands and targets to perform additional build steps or actions.

- **add_custom_command()**: Adds a custom command to the build process. For example, to generate code or documentation:
  > add_custom_command(</br>
    OUTPUT generated_file.cpp</br>
    COMMAND my_generator</br>
    DEPENDS input_file.txt</br>
)

- **add_custom_target()**: Adds a custom target to the build process. For example, to run tests or perform other tasks:
  > add_custom_target(run_tests</br>
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND} --verbose</br>
)

## 4. Cross-Compiling:
CMake supports cross-compiling, allowing you to build for different target platforms than the one you're currently on.

- **Toolchain Files**: Specify a toolchain file using the -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE option to cross-compile. For example:
  
  > cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=my_toolchain.cmake ..


## 5. Package Management:
CMake integrates with package management systems to simplify the integration of third-party libraries into your project.

- **CPack**: Use CPack to package your software into various formats (e.g., ZIP, DEB, RPM) for distribution.

- **ExternalProject**: Use ExternalProject to download and build external projects as part of your build process.

## 6. Debugging and Troubleshooting:
CMake provides various features to debug and troubleshoot your build scripts.

- **Verbose Output**: Use the -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON option to get verbose output during the build process.

- **Message()**: Use message() to print messages during the configuration stage to understand what's happening.
